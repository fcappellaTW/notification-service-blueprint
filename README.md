Welcome! This project is more than just a notification service; it's a **working blueprint** for building robust, scalable, and maintainable serverless applications on AWS.

It was crafted as a learning and mentorship journey, focusing on professional software engineering principles from the ground up.

### 🎯 Project Philosophy

Our goal was to demonstrate how modern software principles can be applied in a serverless context.

* 🏛️ **Clean Architecture:** We use the **Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)** pattern to completely decouple our core business logic from external infrastructure like AWS services. Our `domain` and `application` layers have zero knowledge of how an email is sent or how a request is received.
* 🧪 **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** The entire core logic was built following a strict Red-Green-Refactor cycle. We have 100% test coverage on our business rules, providing maximum confidence. Infrastructure adapters are covered by integration tests.
* 🏗️ **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** All AWS resources are managed declaratively using **Terraform**. This ensures our infrastructure is version-controlled, repeatable, and easy to manage.
* 🔐 **Secure & Robust:** We handle configuration and secrets responsibly, using `.env` files for local development and schema validation with **Zod** to create a bulletproof API entry point.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the service running in your own AWS account.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:
* [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (to manage Node.js versions)
* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
* An AWS Account

### ⚙️ Step-by-Step Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fcappellaTW/notification-service.git
    cd notification-service
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Local Environment**
    This project uses an `.env` file to manage your AWS profile.

    ```bash
    # 1. Copy the example file
    cp .env.example .env

    # 2. Configure an AWS profile with your credentials. This command will ask for your keys.
    #    We recommend using a profile name like 'notification-service'.
    aws configure --profile notification-service

    # 3. Make sure the AWS_PROFILE in your .env file matches the profile you just configured.
    ```

4.  **Configure Infrastructure Variables**
    Terraform needs to know which email address to use as the sender.

    ```bash
    # 1. Navigate to the terraform directory
    cd terraform

    # 2. Copy the example variables file
    cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars

    # 3. Edit terraform.tfvars and set the value for `source_email`.
    ```

5.  **Verify Identities in AWS SES 📧**
    Our service uses AWS SES, which starts in **Sandbox mode** for security. This means you can only send emails **TO** and **FROM** addresses that you have verified.

    * Go to the **Simple Email Service (SES)** console in your AWS account (in the same region as your Terraform provider, e.g., `us-east-1`).
    * Navigate to **Configuration -> Identities**.
    * Create and verify the **sender email** (the one you put in `terraform.tfvars`).
    * Create and verify the **recipient email** you'll use for testing.

### 💻 Development Workflow

* **Run all tests:**
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
* **Check test coverage:**
    ```bash
    npm test -- --coverage
    ```
* **Package the application for deployment:**
    This command compiles the TypeScript, installs production dependencies, and creates the `dist.zip` file needed by Terraform.
    ```bash
    npm run package
    ```

### 🚀 Deployment

With everything configured, deploying is a 3-step process. Make sure you are inside the `terraform/` directory.

1.  **Load Environment Variables**
    From the project root, run:
    ```bash
    source .env
    # Then navigate back to the terraform directory
    cd terraform
    ```

2.  **Initialize Terraform**
    This downloads the necessary AWS provider. You only need to do this once.
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

3.  **Plan the Deployment**
    This shows you what Terraform is about to create. It's a safe dry-run.
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

4.  **Apply the Deployment**
    This will create the resources in your AWS account.
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
    After it finishes, it will output the `api_endpoint` URL.

### ✅ Post-Deployment Testing

Use the provided example script to test your live endpoint.

1.  **Copy the script** (from the project root):
    ```bash
    cp test.sh.example test.sh
    ```
2.  **Edit `test.sh`** and paste the `api_endpoint` URL from the Terraform output.
3.  **Make it executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x test.sh
    ```
4.  **Run it!**
    ```bash
    ./test.sh
    ```
    You should see a success message and receive an email at your verified recipient address! 🎉

### 📈 Next Steps & Tech Debt

This project is a solid foundation. Here are some documented next steps:
* **Terraform S3 Backend:** Configure a remote backend for the Terraform state to enable team collaboration.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Create a GitHub Actions workflow to automate testing and deployment.
* **Optimize with a Bundler:** Refactor the build process to use `esbuild` for faster cold starts and a smaller package size.
